(*
Bifunctors can be curried:

  C × D ⟶ E   -->  C ⟶ [D, E]
  ~~~
  (C, D) -> E  -->  C -> D -> E

Where ~~~ should be read as "Morally equivalent to".

Note: We do not need to define Bifunctors as a separate class, since they can
be derived from functors mapping to a category of functors.  So in the
following two definitions, [P] is effectively our bifunctor.

The trick to [bimap] is that both the [Functor] instances we need (for [fmap]
and [fmap1]), and the [Natural] instance, can be found in the category of
functors we're mapping to by applying [P].
