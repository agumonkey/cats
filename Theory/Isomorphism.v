Section Isomorphism.

Context {C : Category}.

(* This defines what it means for two objects in a category to be
   "isomorphic". This requires both witnesses to the isomoprhism, and proof
   their compositions are equivalent to identity in both directions. Since
   this is a computationally relevant definition, having an isomorphism allows
   for conversion of objects within definitions.

   An isomorphism in Cat is the same as an equivalence of categories. In order
   to get actual isomorphism between categories, the compositions F ○ G and G
   ○ F need to be equal, rather than equivalent, to identity. Since this is
   usually too strong a notion, it does not have its own abstraction here. *)
